## LATTE-LAMMPS Functions
A collection of Python functions useful for working with the LATTE and LAMMPS research codes.

These functions are intended to:
- generate LAMMPS pairwise potential files
- generate tight binding parameterizations in the form of `.skf` files, which LATTE can convert to a usable parameterization with it's built-in converter `DLtab.py`
